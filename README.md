# Richard Stallman Bot
Richard Stallman bot for Discord will remind you to use GNU/Linux and not Linux. ðŸ‘Œ

## *Running the bot*
Im hosting this bot on [replit](https://replit.com/) and thus it has the .replit file. This file isnt needed if youre not hosting on replit. I use [uptimerobot](https://uptimerobot.com) to keep the replit up 24/7. Just copy the url from the replit browser window, set the uptimerobot to http(s) and paste the url into the *URL(or IP)* field.
